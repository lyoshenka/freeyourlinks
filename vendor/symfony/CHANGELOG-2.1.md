### AbstractDoctrineBundle

 * This bundle has been removed and the relevant code has been moved to the Doctrine bridge

### DoctrineBundle

 * This bundle has been moved to the Doctrine organization
 * added optional `group_by` property to `EntityType` that supports either a `PropertyPath` or a `\Closure` that is evaluated on the entity choices
 * The `em` option for the `UniqueEntity` constraint is now optional (and should probably not be used anymore).

### FrameworkBundle

 * added a config:dump-reference command
 * added kernel.event_subscriber tag
 * added a way to create relative symlinks when running assets:install command (--relative option)
 * added Controller::getUser()

    are now prefixed with cookie_ when dumped to the container

### MonologBundle

 * This bundle has been moved to its own repository (https://github.com/symfony/MonologBundle)

### SecurityBundle

 * [BC BREAK] The custom factories for the firewall configuration are now
   registered during the build method of bundles instead of being registered
   by the end-user (you need to remove the 'factories' keys in your security
   configuration).

 * [BC BREAK] The Firewall listener is now registered after the Router one. It
   means that specific Firewall URLs (like /login_check and /logout must now
   have proper route defined in your routing configuration)

 * [BC BREAK] refactored the user provider configuration. The configuration
   changed for the chain provider and the memory provider:

     Before:

     ``` yaml
     security:
         providers:
             my_chain_provider:
                 providers: [my_memory_provider, my_doctrine_provider]
             my_memory_provider:
                 users:
                     toto: { password: foobar, roles: [ROLE_USER] }
                     foo: { password: bar, roles: [ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN] }
     ```

     After:

     ``` yaml
     security:
         providers:
             my_chain_provider:
                 chain:
                     providers: [my_memory_provider, my_doctrine_provider]
             my_memory_provider:
                 memory:
                     users:
                         toto: { password: foobar, roles: [ROLE_USER] }
                         foo: { password: bar, roles: [ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN] }
     ```

 * [BC BREAK] Method `equals` was removed from `UserInterface` to its own new
   `EquatableInterface`, now user class can implement this interface to override
   the default implementation of users equality test.

 * added a validator for the user password
 * added 'erase_credentials' as a configuration key (true by default)
 * added new events: `security.authentication.success` and `security.authentication.failure`
   fired on authentication success/failure, regardless of authentication method,
   events are defined in new event class: `Symfony\Component\Security\Core\AuthenticationEvents`.

 * Added optional CSRF protection to LogoutListener:

   ``` yaml
   security:
       firewalls:
           default:
               logout:
                   path: /logout_path
                   target: /
                   csrf_parameter: _csrf_token        # Optional (defaults to "_csrf_token")
                   csrf_provider:  form.csrf_provider # Required to enable protection
                   intention:      logout             # Optional (defaults to "logout")
   ```

   If the LogoutListener has CSRF protection enabled but cannot validate a token,
   then a LogoutException will be thrown.

 * Added `logout_url` templating helper and Twig extension, which may be used to
   generate logout URL's within templates. The security firewall's config key
   must be specified. If a firewall's logout listener has CSRF protection
   enabled, a token will be automatically added to the generated URL.

### SwiftmailerBundle

 * This bundle has been moved to its own repository (https://github.com/symfony/SwiftmailerBundle)
 * moved the data collector to the bridge
 * replaced MessageLogger class with the one from Swiftmailer 4.1.3

### TwigBundle

 * added the real template name when an error occurs in a Twig template

           remove the table if you are using a DB)

 * added support for the request method
 * added a routing panel
 * added a timeline panel
 * The toolbar position can now be configured via the `position` option (can be `top` or `bottom`)

 * implemented `Serializable` on resources
 * LoaderResolverInterface is now used instead of LoaderResolver for type hinting

 * added support for the shell even if readline is not available
 * added support for process isolation in Symfony shell via `--process-isolation` switch

### ClassLoader

 * added a class map generator
 * added support for loading globally-installed PEAR packages

### DependencyInjection

 * component exceptions that inherit base SPL classes are now used exclusively (this includes dumped containers)

   and only contain letters, digits, underscores, hyphens and colons
 * [BC BREAK] changed default name of the prototype in the "collection" type
   from "$$name$$" to "__name__". No dollars are appended/prepended to custom
   names anymore.

 * [BC BREAK] added SimpleChoiceList and LazyChoiceList as replacement of
   ArrayChoiceList
 * added ChoiceList and ObjectChoiceList to use objects as choices
 * [BC BREAK] removed EntitiesToArrayTransformer and EntityToIdTransformer.
   The former has been replaced by CollectionToArrayTransformer in combination
   with EntityChoiceList, the latter is not required in the core anymore.

 * [BC BREAK] renamed

   * ArrayToBooleanChoicesTransformer to ChoicesToBooleanArrayTransformer
   * ScalarToBooleanChoicesTransformer to ChoiceToBooleanArrayTransformer
   * ArrayToChoicesTransformer to ChoicesToValuesTransformer
   * ScalarToChoiceTransformer to ChoiceToValueTransformer

   to be consistent with the naming in ChoiceListInterface.

 * [BC BREAK] removed FormUtil::toArrayKey() and FormUtil::toArrayKeys().
   They were merged into ChoiceList and have no public equivalent anymore.
 * choice fields now throw a FormException if neither the "choices" nor the
   "choice_list" option is set

 * removed the ContentTypeMimeTypeGuesser class as it is deprecated and never used on PHP 5.3
 * added ResponseHeaderBag::makeDisposition() (implements RFC 6266)
 * made mimetype to extension conversion configurable
 * [BC BREAK] Moved all session related classes and interfaces into own namespace, as
   `Symfony\Component\HttpFoudation\Session` and renamed classes accordingly.
 * Added `FlashBag`. Flashes expire when retrieved by `get()` or `all()`.
   This makes the implementation ESI compatible.
 * Added `AutoExpireFlashBag` (default) to replicate Symfony 2.0.x auto expire behaviour of messages auto expiring
   after one page page load.  Messages must be retrived by `get()` or `all()`.
 * [BC BREAK] Removed the `close()` method from the Session class
 * Deprecated the following methods from the Session class: `setFlash()`, `setFlashes()`
   `getFlash()`, `hasFlash()`, and `removeFlash()`. Use `getFlashBag() instead which returns a `FlashBagInterface`.
 * `Session->clear()` now only clears session attributes as before it cleared flash messages and
   attributes. `Session->getFlashBag()->all()` clears flashes now.
 * Added `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Session\Storage\AbstractSessionStorage` base class for
   session storage drivers.
 * Added `SessionHandlerInterface` interface which storage drivers should implement after inheriting from
   `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Session\Storage\AbstractSessionStorage` when writing custom
   session save handlers using PHP 5.3.  This interface is a stub for the PHP 5.4 interface.
 * [BC BREAK] `SessionStorageInterface` methods removed: `write()`, `read()` and `remove()`.  Added
   `getBag()`, `registerBag()`.
 * Moved attribute storage to `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Attribute\AttributeBagInterface`.
 * Added `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Attribute\AttributeBag` to replicate attributes storage
   behaviour from 2.0.x (default).

 * Session now implements `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Session\SessionInterface` making
   implementation customizable and portable.

 * [BC BREAK] convert the `item` XML tag to an array

     ``` xml
     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <response>
         <item><title><![CDATA[title1]]></title></item><item><title><![CDATA[title2]]></title></item>
     </response>
     ```

     Before:

          Array()

     After:

          Array(
              [item] => Array(
                  [0] => Array(
                      [title] => title1
                  )
                  [1] => Array(
                      [title] => title2
                  )
